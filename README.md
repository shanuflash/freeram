# THIS VERSION IS DEPRECATED PLEASE USE THE JAVA VERSION!
**You can download free ram? (maybe)**

~~Designed and coded by @shanuflash<br>
Thanks @Microsoft for their amazing RAMMap.exe~~

## ~~How to run?<br>~~
~~Extract the .rar file and run freeram.exe as an admin, it'll create 
a startup profile and do its thing, silently in the background.~~

## ~~How it works.<br>~~
- ~~Windows being the mess that it is uses a completely folly and obselete form of memory management. This program clears the working set memory every hour and frees up ram.~~
- ~~Empty Working Sets removes memory from all user-mode and system working sets to the standby or modified page lists.<br>~~
- ~~Note that by the time you refresh the data, processes that run any code will necessarily populate their working sets to do so.<br>~~
- ~~Simply put it kinda is **FREE RAM**!~~

## ~~How do I check if it works?~~
- ~~Note down ram usage before using 'FreeRam' and then run the program. You'll notice visible
decrease in the usage.~~
